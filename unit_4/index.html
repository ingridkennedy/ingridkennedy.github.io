	<p>In its second season of programming, KLAUSGALLERY.net is pleased to partner with editor Brian Droitcour to present Klaus_eBooks. The mission of Klaus_eBooks is to publish and distribute a new series of artists' ebooks for tablets and ereaders. These ebooks are self-contained, time-based and potentially narrative, involving a mixture of reading and interactive viewing, and exemplifying the erasure of distinctions between art and literature in digital media.<br><br>

A new Klaus_eBook will be published every three weeks, and will be available on iPad or Kindle via the iTunes store and Amazon.com. Links to these sites, along with additional material including videos and exclusive content will be available on KLAUSGALLERY.net.<br><br>

KLAUSGALLERY.net, in its first season of programming, functioned as an online exhibition project by dedicated to premiering new work by emerging and established artists whose practices engage the Internet. Envisioned in partnership with artist and curator Duncan Malashock, the project consisted of a series of two-week-long online solo and group exhibitions, accompanied by events at Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery.<br><br>

Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery, in Winter 2013, enters its ninth year of commitment to showing new work by artists in a multitude of media.</p>
